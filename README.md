# Wpcli

Simple wrapper for wp-cli (http://wp-cli.org/).

Just pass commands (http://wp-cli.org/commands/) to run method and use returned hash as you wish.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wpcli', "~> 0.1.1"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wpcli

## Rails

Simplest way to use in rails is to create config file and use methods from module.

Generate example config

    rails g wpcli:config

Generated file (config/wpcli.yml)

    apps:
        key_for_installation: /absolute/path/for/my/wp-installation

In controller include module

    class MyController < ApplicationController
      include Wpcli

And then you can use client with key:

     users = wpcli(:key_for_installation).run "user list"

## Alternative way

If you like to use client for example in command line, you can create instance with path of wordpress installation

    @wpcli = Wpcli::Client.new "path/to/wp"
    users = @wpcli.run "user list"
